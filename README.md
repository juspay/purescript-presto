Write apps like equations!

Code as simple and precise as Mathematical Expressions. Presto is written in PureScript harnessing the powers of Functional Programming & Category Theory. What you get is scalable, performant code with elegant abstractions. Our attempt with Presto is to really simplify the app development process.

## Quickstart

You can get your hands dirty by building a mobile recharge app using Presto

```
git clone https://github.com/juspay/purescript-presto.git
cd purescript-presto/examples/billpay-react
npm i
bower i
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:8080/dist/ in your browser.

## Code Snippet

```
billPayFlow :: Flow BillPayFailure StatusScreenAction
billPayFlow = do
  _            <- UI.splashScreen
  operators    <- Remote.fetchOperators
  operator     <- UI.chooseOperator operators
  mobileNumber <- UI.askMobileNumber
  amount       <- UI.askAmount
  result       <- Remote.payBill mobileNumber amount operator
  UI.billPayStatus mobileNumber amount result
```
